2. Simon and I both discussed the prep work and were able to help each other out 
   when we were confused. Simon helped me with the state diagram and I helped him
   with the timer module. We both worked on testbenches (separately at first), and 
   then at the end we collaborated and filled in gaps for each of us.

3. We met 4 times this week in person, and we messaged each other semi-frequenty.

4. I contributed to the prep and testbench phases. See 2 for more details.

5. See 2 for more details.

6. Mine. I created my own testbench.
