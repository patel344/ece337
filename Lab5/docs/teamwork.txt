2. Simon, Caleb, and I worked on the state diagram together. I primarily worked on the RTL diagrams
   for the magnitude block, and the controller block. Caleb primarily worked on the pseudocode, and 
   Simon worked primarily on the state diagrams.
  
   We also had very productive debugging discussions. Also after talking to the TA, we found out that 
   doing the coefficient addition/subtraction in the order of add,sub,add,sub is better, and prevents
   overflow from occuring. However, we were not told this until after we had already individually had 
   programmed up the FSM, and after talking to the TA found out that we were able to keep our original 
   logic and simply switch the ordering.

   We thoroughly discussed the design phase in order to make the coding go smoothly. We agreed upon a 
   common general design, so we were better able to help each other out.

3. We met 3 times this week in person, and we messaged each other semi-frequenty.

4. I contributed to the preparation phase, and debugging discussions, as well as the design discussions.

5. See 2 for more details.
