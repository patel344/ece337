Question 1)
	
	data_ready must be asserted for 2 clk cycles

	Data must be valid for 2 clk cycles. 1 from idle->store, and 1 from store->zero because until we get to zero we dont know for sure if the value was stored or went to eidle

Question 2) 
	
	The filtered images show only certain frequencies of the original image. This makes sense because it is filtering out the high freq values being a HPF. The different images are changing based on the coefficients.



Question 3)
	
	$fopen(filename, mode);
	$fscanf(file, file_format_specifier, data_source)

Question 4)

	%b, %c, %d, %e, %f, %g, %h, %l, %m, %o, %s, %t, %u, %v, %z
